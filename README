Just a quick implementation of a GraphQL server using Python 3.5.2, Django, and Graphene.

Want to try it out?
1. Clone repo.
1. Set up virtualenv with Python 3.5.2
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the root of the repo.
1. `cd cookbook` and then `python manage.py runserver`
1. Head to `http://localhost:8000/graphql` to mess around with it.
